I would like to present my deep appreciation to my supervisor Professor Aaron Quigley for his guidance of my dissertation in the summer. Without his directions and insightful suggestions I could not finish the development of the system introduced in the dissertation, which made me full of the sense of accomplishment and pleasure. Also I very appreciate the kind help from Dr. David Harris-Birtill, who provided valuable comments for my design of the evaluation and the writing of the dissertation.

It is an unforgettable year in my life to study here in St Andrews with amazing lecturers and classmates, and to finish the dissertation. I would always appreciate the knowledge and skills I learned and the experience I gained, with the sincere hope of coming back soon.
